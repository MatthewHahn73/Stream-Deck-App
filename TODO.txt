		-Settings don't save on updating application from the GUI
			-Likely due to the local settings file, not the one in /home/$USER/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/StreamDeck/
		-Need to set the shell script for the auto-installation to execute as a program
	Unreplicable
		-Website rarely don't launch properly if multiple different streaming services are accessed in a short period of time one after the other
			-Seems to only happen on firefox on the actual steam deck
		-On very rare occassions, the application will launch in the wrong aspect ratio, resulting in black bars at the bottom of the screen
