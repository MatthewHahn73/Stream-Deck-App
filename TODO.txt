Bugs
	-Website rarely doesn't launch properly if multiple different sites accessed in a short period of time
	
TODO
	-Installation script
		-One click installation script to create the steam shortcut and populate its artwork
		-Script generates the non-steam shortcut but doesn't properly generate a usable AppID
			-Everytime steam boots it generates a different one, seperate of the one in shortcuts.vdf
				-This prevents the artwork from being able to be set properly
				-This also means that even if the user was to set the artwork manually, it wouldn't load, since the ID wouldve been regenerated after a different boot
				-Most other automation scripts use existing game IDs. Need to look into how SteamGridDB generates its AppIDs since it can still populate artwork for games not available on steam
	-Additional options
		-CrunchyRoll 
	-Update the github page
		-Gif(s) of functionality
		-Feature list
		-Controller config
			-Either copy or reference to search in steam
