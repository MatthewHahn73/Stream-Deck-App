Bugs
	-Website rarely doesn't launch properly if multiple different streaming services accessed in a short period of time
	-Settings don't save on updating application from the GUI
		-Likely due to caching in /home/$USER/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/StreamDeck/
		-Maybe something to do with the local Settings.json file?
	-Upon updating, the install scripts and python modules folder persist in the application directory
		-Need to delete these from the application
	
TODO
	-Additional Testing
		-Lots of potential issues with the update functionality
			-Set up some test cases?
		-Do some extra testing with the auto install script
	-Additional options
		-CrunchyRoll 
	-Update the github page
		-Gif(s) of functionality
		-Feature list
		-Controller config
			-Either copy or reference to search in steam
